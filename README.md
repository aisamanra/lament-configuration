# Lament Configuration

Bookmark organizing for pinheads.

## Planned Features

- [ ] Hierarchical tags: every link tagged with `#food/bread` will also be visible under `#food`
- [ ] Collections: your top-level view of links can optionally be several folder-like divisions instead of a single tagged soup of link
- [ ] Optional image previews: links can be viewed in text view or in thumbnail view, and this setting should be sticky on a per-collection basis
- [ ] Some kind of bookmarklet for adding links, of course
